This is a site I made to track movies I've seen or want to watch, this is my first major project using TailwindCSS as well as an introduction to using NextJS's beta `app` directory structure (https://beta.nextjs.org/docs/getting-started).

This app is written with React and NextJS with MongoDB as my database, I am using The Movie Database (www.themoviedb.org) for movie/tv information.
